## Inspiration
There is rising depression in the world, and the reason is that people are going outside to meet new people a lot less ever since the pandemic. We realized that we had less friends since the pandemic, and would go outside a lot less. 
## What it does
Spotter helps people find real places nearby to hang out based on activity from users. 
## How we built it
It takes reviews from people, and a "vibe" of a certain location, then recommends places to the user in both list format and a 3d map using threlte. 
## Challenges we ran into
The time frame was very limited so we had to leave a lot of stuff unpolished, such as the location sorting algorithm and the 3d map. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
For two of us, this was the first time we touched web development, so this project was a good intro to web development. 
## What we learned
Elements of web development and design in general, as well as using 3d models and APIs in websites. 
Svelte, Threlte, new types of coding, as well as typescript and javascript
## What's next for Spotter
Polishing the UI and UX in general to make it easier to interact with the website. Also, adding an algorithm to make connection between certain places and recommendations better.
